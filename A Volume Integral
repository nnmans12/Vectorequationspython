eA volume integral is a precise summation of the space with in a surface using the integration method of a defined function. 
This is done by using the sum of infinitesimal cubic volumes dxdydz to achieve precise volumes for larger non linear closed surfaces that are integrable. 
A surface which contains discontinuities can be iterated by splitting the surface into more than one equation. 
Approximation methods such as the Taylor series can be used for surfaces that canâ€™t be defined by an equation, a Taylor series approximates a function with a polynomial equation to an nth exponent.
